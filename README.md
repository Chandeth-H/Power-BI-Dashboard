In this summary dashboard, we present key metrics from our loan portfolio, highlighting both overall performance and the characteristics of good and bad loans. In 2021, our bank has issued approximately 14.4K loan applications, with around 1.7K issued in the latest month—an 18.9% increase compared to the previous month. The total funded amount stands at $169.0 million, including $22.3 million in the latest month, reflecting a 24.1% month-over-month growth. Repayments received total $183.5 million, with $24.1 million collected in the latest month, marking a 29.5% increase. The average interest rate across all loans is 12.3%, rising to 12.7% in the latest month—a 5% increase. The average debt-to-income (DTI) ratio is 13.4%, with the latest month showing a slight increase to 13.8% (+2.8% MoM). 

Regarding loan quality, 84.1% of issued loans are classified as good—defined as loans that are either fully paid or currently active—while 15.9% are considered bad, referring to loans that have been charged off. Good loans account for approximately 12.1K applications, with $140.9 million funded and $167.2 million repaid. In contrast, bad loans total around 2.3K applications, with $28.2 million funded and only $16.2 million repaid. 

Breaking down loan status further, fully paid loans comprise 11,587 applications totaling $132.05 million, with an average interest rate of 11.85% and a DTI ratio of 13.09%. Current loans include 513 applications with $8.79 million funded, an average interest rate of 15.09%, and a DTI ratio of 14.93%. Charged-off loans total 2,284 applications, with $28.17 million funded, an average interest rate of 13.99%, and a DTI ratio of 14.31%. 

This first dashboard allows users to filter data by state, loan grade, and loan purpose for more detailed insights.

In the second dashboard, we focus on analyzing key loan metrics such as the total number of loan applications, total funded amount, and total repayment received. These metrics are broken down across various dimensions including month, state, loan term, employee length, loan purpose, and home ownership status. 

To enhance the analytical capability, we’ve introduced a filter of good vs bad loan and an additional filter that allows users to select one of the three main metrics—applications, funded amount, or repayment received—on top of the existing filters from the first dashboard. This enables users to explore each metric independently and gain deeper insights into how different factors influence loan performance.

The final dashboard provides detailed insights into individual loans. Users can view a comprehensive loan table that includes key information such as loan ID, loan purpose, home ownership status, loan grade and sub-grade, issued date, funded amount, interest rate, installment amount, and the total repayment received. Each loan is displayed row by row, allowing for easy comparison and analysis. 

To support deeper exploration, the dashboard includes filters for state, loan grade, and loan quality (good vs. bad), enabling users to narrow down the data and examine specific segments of the loan portfolio.
